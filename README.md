# Disclaimer

**Use at your own risk**

Included in ```./build``` are pre-built certificates for testing purposes, obviously don't use these the wild as these keys are now compromised being on GitHub.

You're also comprising your browser by leaving these pre-built keys installed.

```sh
python https_auth_server.py
```

python https_auth_server.py localhost 4443 test:test ./build/server-key.pem ./build/server-cert.pem
```
